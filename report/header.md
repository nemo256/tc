In the last century, the internet is becoming more and more important for us humans, as it is used for literally everything we do, we access it daily to do various activities such as shopping, communicating, checking the map..., and that's why we need websites to do such things.

Problem: Nowadays, it is a long and hard journey to develop a website, it is both expensive and hard for developers to create a website, Web development has seen a huge advent of Single Page Application (SPA) in the past couple of years. Early development was simpleâ€”reload a complete page to perform a change in the display or perform a user action. The problem with this was a huge round-trip time for the complete request to reach the web server and back to the client.

Then came NextJS, which provides a great user experience, ease of use and automatic code splitting that benefits both beginner and advanced developers.

To present our work, we have devised our report into three chapters:
The first chapter contains a general study about web development, components technology and how NextJS can be your next technology to learn.
The second chapter consists of various diagrams that are the roots of developing our website.
The last chapter consists of two parts the part that contains all the tools / languages we used and the second part is showcasing our website with its various functionalities.
